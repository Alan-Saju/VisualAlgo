# VisualAlgo

**VisualAlgo** is an interactive web-based platform for visualizing classic computer science algorithms and data structures. It helps learners understand algorithm behavior and data structure operations through step-by-step animations and intuitive user interfaces.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Sorting Algorithms**  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Counting Sort  
  - Radix Sort

- 🧭 **Pathfinding Algorithms**  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  

- 🔗 **Data Structures**  
  - Singly Linked List  
  - Doubly Linked List  
  - Queue

- 📊 **Graph Algorithms**  
  - Kruskal's Algorithm  
  - Prim's Algorithm  
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm (if implemented)
